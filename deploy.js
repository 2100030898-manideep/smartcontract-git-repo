Deployment Process:
1.Configure Deployment Parameters: Set up deployment configurations such as network provider URL, gas limit, and gas price in truffle-config.js or hardhat.config.js.
2.Deploy Contracts: Use a script (deploy.js) to deploy the compiled contracts to the desired network. This script should handle the deployment process, including interacting with MetaMask for transaction signing.
3.Verify Contract Deployment: After deployment, verify the contract on Etherscan or any other block explorer if necessary.
