Checking Output Using Remix IDE and MetaMask:
1.Connect to Remix IDE: Open Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/) 
2.Import Contracts: Import the Solidity contract file (MyContract.sol) into Remix.
3.Compile Contracts: Compile the imported contract in Remix.
4.Deploy Contracts: Deploy the compiled contract using MetaMask as the wallet provider. Ensure that MetaMask is connected to the same network where the contracts were deployed.
5.Interact with Contracts: After deployment, interact with the deployed contract using Remix IDE and MetaMask to test its functionality.
6.Check Output: Use Remix IDE's debugging and testing features to verify the output and behavior of the deployed contract.
